TECHNIQUE: Inductive Loop Sensor
Data Collection and Modeling of Inductive Loop Sensors for Traffic Control
1. Introduction
Inductive Loop Sensors Overview
Inductive loop sensors are widely used in traffic management systems to detect vehicles and measure traffic parameters. These sensors utilize electromagnetic induction principles to identify the presence of metal objects (e.g., vehicles) over a coil embedded in the road surface. They are essential for real-time traffic monitoring, providing valuable data on vehicle presence, volume, speed, and occupancy. Key advantages of inductive loop sensors include their high reliability, robustness in various environmental conditions, and minimal maintenance requirements.
